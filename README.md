# Fuzzy-logic-throttle-controller

**Steps performed**
a) Identify input fuzzy sets for the three crisp variables. 
b) Define fuzzy control rules (Mamdani or TSK) that you think are appropriate for throttle 
control. 
c) Calculated fuzzy memberships and corresponding throttle (as a %) for a given crisp input 
state. 
d) Present the control surface and evaluate its quality. 
e) Used a simple vehicle model and simulated the FLC in Matlab.
