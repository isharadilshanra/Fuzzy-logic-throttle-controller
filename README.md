# Fuzzy-logic-throttle-controller

**Steps performed**
- Identify input fuzzy sets for the three crisp variables. 
- Define fuzzy control rules (Mamdani or TSK) that you think are appropriate for throttle 
control. 
- Calculated fuzzy memberships and corresponding throttle (as a %) for a given crisp input 
state. 
- Present the control surface and evaluate its quality. 
- Used a simple vehicle model and simulated the FLC in Matlab.
